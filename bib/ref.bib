abstract = {A long-standing goal of artificial intelligence is an algorithm that learns, tabula rasa, superhuman proficiency in challenging domains. Recently, AlphaGo became the first program to defeat a world champion in the game of Go. The tree search in AlphaGo evaluated positions and selected moves using deep neural networks. These neural networks were trained by supervised learning from human expert moves, and by reinforcement learning from self-play. Here we introduce an algorithm based solely on reinforcement learning, without human data, guidance or domain knowledge beyond game rules. AlphaGo becomes its own teacher: a neural network is trained to predict AlphaGo's own move selections and also the winner of AlphaGo's games. This neural network improves the strength of the tree search, resulting in higher quality move selection and stronger self-play in the next iteration. Starting tabula rasa, our new program AlphaGo Zero achieved superhuman performance, winning 100-0 against the previously published, champion-defeating AlphaGo.},

abstract = {Cloud computing technology has rapidly evolved over the last decade, offering an alternative way to store and work with large amounts of data. However data security remains an important issue particularly when using a public cloud service provider. The recent area of homomorphic cryptography allows computation on encrypted data, which would allow users to ensure data privacy on the cloud and increase the potential market for cloud computing. A significant amount of research on homomorphic cryptography appeared in the literature over the last few years; yet the performance of existing implementations of encryption schemes remains unsuitable for real time applications. One way this limitation is being addressed is through the use of graphics processing units (GPUs) and field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) for implementations of homomorphic encryption schemes. This review presents the current state of the art in this promising new area of research and highlights the interesting remaining open problems. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

@article{Armknecht2013,
abstract = {We give a complete characterization both in terms of security and design of all currently existing group homomorphic encryption schemes, i.e., existing encryption schemes with a group homomorphic decryption function such as ElGamal and Paillier. To this end, we formalize and identify the basic underlying structure of all existing schemes and say that such schemes are of shift-type. Then, we construct an abstract scheme that represents all shift-type schemes (i.e., every scheme occurs as an instantiation of the abstract scheme) and prove its IND-CCA1 (resp. IND-CPA) security equivalent to the hardness of an abstract problem called Splitting Oracle-Assisted Subgroup Membership Problem (SOAP) (resp. Subgroup Membership Problem, SMP). Roughly, SOAP asks for solving an SMP instance, i.e., for deciding whether a given ciphertext is an encryption of the neutral element of the ciphertext group, while allowing access to a certain oracle beforehand. Our results allow for contributing to a variety of open problems such as the IND-CCA1 security of Paillier's scheme, or the use of linear codes in group homomorphic encryption. Furthermore, we design a new cryptosystem which provides features that are unique up to now: Its IND-CPA security is based on the k-linear problem introduced by Shacham, and Hofheinz and Kiltz, while its IND-CCA1 security is based on a new k-problem that we prove to have the same progressive property, namely that if the k-instance is easy in the generic group model, the (k+1)-instance is still hard. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

@article{Acar2018,
abstract = {Legacy encryption systems depend on sharing a key (public or private) among the peers involved in exchanging an encrypted message. However, this approach poses privacy concerns. The users or service providers with the key have exclusive rights on the data. Especially with popular cloud services, control over the privacy of the sensitive data is lost. Even when the keys are not shared, the encrypted material is shared with a third party that does not necessarily need to access the content. Moreover, untrusted servers, providers, and cloud operators can keep identifying elements of users long after users end the relationship with the services. Indeed, Homomorphic Encryption (HE), a special kind of encryption scheme, can address these concerns as it allows any third party to operate on the encrypted data without decrypting it in advance. Although this extremely useful feature of the HE scheme has been known for over 30 years, the first plausible and achievable Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) scheme, which allows any computable function to perform on the encrypted data, was introduced by Craig Gentry in 2009. Even though this was a major achievement, different implementations so far demonstrated that FHE still needs to be improved significantly to be practical on every platform. Therefore, this survey focuses on HE and FHE schemes. First, we present the basics of HE and the details of the well-known Partially Homomorphic Encryption (PHE) and Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption (SWHE), which are important pillars for achieving FHE. Then, the main FHE families, which have become the base for the other follow-up FHE schemes, are presented. Furthermore, the implementations and recent improvements in Gentry-type FHE schemes are also surveyed. Finally, further research directions are discussed. This survey is intended to give a clear knowledge and foundation to researchers and practitioners interested in knowing, applying, and extending the state-of-the-art HE, PHE, SWHE, and FHE systems.},

abstract = {Secret Image Sharing (SIS) scheme is to encrypt a secret image into ‘n' specious shadows. It is unable to reveal any data on the secret image if at least one of the shadows is not achieved. In this paper, wavelet-based secret image sharing scheme is proposed with encrypted shadow images using optimal Homomorphic Encryption (HE) technique. Initially, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is applied on the secret image to produce sub bands. From this process, multiple shadows are created, encrypted and decrypted for each shadow. The encrypted shadow can be recovered just by choosing some subset of these ‘n' shadows that makes transparent and stack over each other. To improve the shadow security, each shadow is encrypted and decrypted using HE technique. For the concern on image quality, the new Oppositional based Harmony Search (OHS) algorithm was utilized to generate the optimal key. From the analysis, it shows that the proposed scheme provide greater security compared to other existing schemes.},
